    diseaseType: 'Bacterial Disease',
    Clinical:
      'The most recognizable clinical signs of disease are hemorrhagic fin and tail erosions, cutaneous hemorrhage and skin ulcerations.',
    Control:
      'As A. hydrophila is a ubiquitous organism in both the fish and environment, control is primarily focused on good management practices of reducing stress in the fish by supplying optimal water quality, avoiding overcrowding, proper handling, providing good nutrition, and preventing parasitic or fungal infections. The use of antibiotics, various chemicals and vaccinations have been used with limited success.',

    diseaseType: 'Bacterial Disease',
    Clinical:
      'Pathological changes are usually confined to gills, skin and fins, but in some cases oral mucosa can be compromised. Systemic infections and internal lesions are uncommon and normally occur after the external tissues have been breached. Disease can be acute, subacute or chronic, depending on the conditions of the outbreak, the fish species and the virulence of the strain involved.',
    Control:
      'Whenever possible prevention is the best approach to control this disease. Decreasing fish biomass density, organic load, and ammonia and nitrite levels are important to diminish the risk of developing columnaris disease. Although not widely available, the use of fish genetically selected for higher resistance to this infection will probably be an important measure to control this disease.',

    diseaseType: 'Parasitic Disease',
    Clinical:
      'Infestations of I. multifiliis or C. irritans can often be seen grossly on the skin and fins as the mature trophont stage can range up to 1 mm in size producing the appearance of small, white, raised bumps on the surface of the skin and fins Other times the infestation may only appear as small, nonspecific skin lesions where the parasite penetrates through the epithelium of the skin and fins as it enters or exits from the host . Infected fish will congregate near water intakes, “flash” and rub against the substrate and objects within the environment, have increased opercular rates, and have increased mucus production on the skin and gills.',
    Control:
      'Control of these parasites is based on isolation of fish upon arrival and periodic monitoring for infection during the quarantine period. Environmental management of the water with UV treatment or raising the temperature above 30°C for tolerant fish species has been shown to reduce the number of infectious theronts in the water.',

    diseaseType: 'Viral Disease',
    Clinical:
      'lethargy, enteritis, peritonitis, oedema, exophthalmia, thickening of the swim bladder and petechial haemorrhages in the internal organs, skin and muscle (Plate・4.1). Many scientists regard distension of the abdomen as the main feature of the disease. However, other clinical signs can include emaciation and erratic swimming movements, the latter denoting ataxia. Mortalities are usually fairly low at first, but level out to steady daily losses, depending on the environmental conditions, e.g. low water temperatureand level of secondary infections.',
    Control:
      'Prevention is only effective where there are no introductions of infected fish into new areas. The mode of transmission of the disease appears to be horizontal, with the possibility of transmission by leeches and other ectoparasites as well as piscivorous birds. Obviously, the spread of this disease has been greatly increased by the movements of fish as part of the worldwide trade in carp.',
